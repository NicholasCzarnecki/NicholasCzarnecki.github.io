        <h2>Bands I've Been In</h2>
        <p>
          I joined my first band,
          <a
            class="band-link"
            href="https://soundcloud.com/thewoodrowaffair/tracks"
            target="_blank"
            >The Woodrow Affair</a
          >, back in 2011 which kickstarted my musical journey. We were an indie
          band that just wanted to get out, have fun, and play some live music.
          We never got around to touring because our singer chose to pursue an
          acting career in NYC just when we were picking up steam. It was fun
          while it lasted and helped me get comfortable in a live setting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now my second band was something special.
          <a
            class="band-link"
            href="https://givemegravity.bandcamp.com/"
            target="_blank"
            >Give Me Gravity</a
          >
          was formed in 2012 and gave me some of my best memories that I'll
          carry until the end of my days. We considered ourselves alternative
          rock with some progressive elements sprinkled in. We had some radio
          success and were featured on a local radio station, WMMR, here in
          Philadelphia. We also had the opportunity to play at the TLA not once,
          but twice, which was a huge accomplishment for us. We did get to take
          our show on the road and do a gig in Boston, but we wound up parting
          ways with our drummer shortly after.
        </p>
        <p>
          My third band,
          <a
            class="band-link"
            href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/213hD2aVMEkRI5JkRqK61h?si=sMcV8FlZQZipqwZtog1-ww"
            target="_blank"
            >AMGEM</a
          >, consisted of the original members of Give Me Gravity with the
          addition of a new drummer....basically Give Me Gravity 2.0. We
          recorded a full length album and played 2 shows before we lost our
          drummer again. Maybe we'll do a reunion show one of these days....
