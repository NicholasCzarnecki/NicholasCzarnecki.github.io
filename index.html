        <p>
          I’m a recent LaunchCode LC101 graduate who is looking to expand my
          skills in full stack web development and game development. I'm from
          West Philadelphia, born and raised. On the playground is where I spent
          most of my days. While I call Philadelphia my home, I've also had the
          opportunity to travel the world. With a lot of grit and hard work, I
          was able to excel in my previous career in logistics and travel the
          world while taking in the vast cultures of places that were very
          foreign to me. I took on the challenge of learning computer
          programming to change careers and take my life into a new direction.
          I’m looking to embrace this career change and bring my skill set from
          my previous career to the ever evolving field of technology.
